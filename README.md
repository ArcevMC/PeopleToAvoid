# People To Avoid
This list is for people that have unjustly done wrong things to me or others.

**» Jaymesss

  Discord Client ID: 491775096298536981 (jaymesss#0001)

  Server Owner of PolyMC. (Also provided resources for the actual server, Hub, etc)

  Situation:
    I was a Trial-Mod on PolyMC accepted by a friend of mine surge360 (Well-known HCF member). There was other staff members too promoted
  by surge and the owners. Particularly Newtt#2064 who was a "egirl" who often would be a toxic to me only (for no reason). This lead on people
  that didnt know me to put a bad taste in the entire staff team and other owners. Zerkz (Main Owner) is understanding and happens to knows me a little in the time I was in the server.
  On 8/5/2019, at 7:34pm I was banned from the PolyMC discord and in-game. Naturally, I wanted to know the reason behind the ban. After about 5 mins jaymesss responded by
  saying "because no one likes you" claiming I was annoying as a reason. I acted naturally in the time I was on the server and was never asked once to desist from any behaviour
  that would be "annoying". For future reference for anyone playing PolyMC and are seeing this, please avoid playing on the server when jaymesss is an owner.
  He promotes toxicity and other unjust things and are the catalyst for why the HCF community is such in a deep hole of bad people and bad actions.
  
**» Disclearing/Gr0unded/Apifile/Dripdon1/Brexit/brexitisexit

Apifile is on just about every "Skid-list" on github he is no expectation here either he is well-known in this community for his misdeeds and actions towards users regardless of what he claims he will never change nor do anything that is worth attention. he has also griefed servers such as GTMinecart and small servers, he will honestly join a new hcf server as a developer and then wait for their release and then leak their files and user's IPS 2 days later so it hurts the server's rep and causes them to quit. he also rooms blackspigot in order to gain a following from that shitty site's community full of ratters.
All and all do not trust Apifile with any kind of access to your server or any communication with him he backdoors anything he provides and can't even use eclipse properly half the time.

» BabyClew/Clew/Simpsons/Xo Mericals/Shiroshu/improvisors/Mr. Zilex Client(Credit to C0an for the name)
BabyClew better known as "Clew" has the same reputation as Disclearing if not worse, there is countless evidence that proves this user only cares for his network (Zilex Network) and money. if you even attempt to create a video on this user you can guarantee when you check your email the next day or so you'll have a strike and the the video will be removed or all profits will go clew. below is screenshots of some of his interesting threats.

**» BabyAvaah/Avaah/depressedava

Ava is someone who isn't a "skidder" rather someone who has in DevCole's words "a hungry little motherfucker jumping from boy to boy every 2 weeks" "Avaah" is been exposed as being a male pretending to be a female (There is nothing wrong with being transgender) however in ava's case "He" was using his "Persona" of being a female to lore boys in to use them for power in the case of Warfine I personally warned FigT at the time "She" was using him for Owner and Power but at the time FigT was blinded by love and I understand the feeling no hate to him. he quickly pushed ava to the curb once he found out ava was a dude.
Avaah at the time of creating his list is still a Moderator on PvP Land, I ask that you all go and report this information to the managers as someone who is like this doesn't deserve any rank on any server in this community and should just quit minecraft and do something with their lives.

**» ZeflyYT/Zefly/EliteSmooth/Misthought

Zefly is someone who claims to be the best developer but can only use leaked code that can be found either on blackspigot or provided to him by a third party, Zefly has "Created" a few "Custom"(iHCF leaked code) cores and has scammed people out of money and time. he created TazeHQ a server that ended up becoming an IP Farm and caused for a lot of user's IPs being leaked. he has leaked broken cores onto his channel to get a following from 13 year olds that can't simply buy a core from mc-market that actually works.

His "Core Leaks" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEWRVppzMHo

There we more but he took down all of his videos on his main channel that video is what remains

**» ItzAssassin/Ethan**

Networks: HCStatic, HCRival

ItzAssassin has a history of "using" people and ignoring people who made him famous, ItzAssassin was an Owner of HCStatic and has scummed a lot of people, DeleteKey provided me with this statement.
"He basically sold his server hcstatic to tank tracks and other people who I forgot and basically people bought rank but the server never came out or had a beta. Then itzassassin rebought it or whatever and made people rebuy ranks even if they had them on the hcstatic sold to tank tracks. And idk if anyone bought ranks but 2 months after the fact seemed like he only cared about hcrival and didn't give a shit about the people on hcstatic and the people who bought ranks Also not to mention he has owned servers will with Zefly in the past so wouldn't be surprised if he used skidded plugins" - DeleteKey#1342
Regardless of that, ItzAssassin has been recently exposed for "skidding" Nova Client (A PvP Based Client created by PlumpOrange) and claiming it to be "HCRival Client" once this spread ItzAssassin had gone into "Damage Control" by explaining the situation and then removing the client from public eye and then for a brief time shouting out Nova, everything was good then until he removed the discord link and just now ignores the situation.

NovaClient Drama https://twitter.com/Nova_Client/status/1155917743239180288

All and all ItzAssassin's following is just Botted users or just blind people that believe every word he states. utterly a blind fool.

**» Caiy

Discord Client ID: 565626459054538772 (Caiy#0368)

Server Owner of HCPvP (Provided nothing for the in-game content or structure, except for discord)

Situation:
I was a Developer hired to build HCPvP's entire structure of plugins, security and other aspects of the server.
As first it was just me and Caiy and he was willing to pay me to simply compile plugins he had. I never completed any of the compiles and he wasnt really interested entirely at first. After that he bought HCPvP's name and rights, He then offered me to work with a 50/50 split, I took it. After about a couple of weeks he had a second person as a shareholder named Dylan. Dylan bought resources from a third party previously without me knowing and Caiy wanted to modify and use them. The inital agreement was verbal and based on what resources we had. On First Glance, they had enough money based on the fact that they paid a pretty penny for their resources. However, when they started making the HCPvP structure with me what ended up happening is when I was developing it and working they were putting in deadlines and setting up dates for release (Which wasnt right considering the work that needed done). Common annoying questions were "Is the core done yet?" or "Hows the core going?" which is fine. However, it got to the point where I had to tell him that it will be done when its done type of response. After some time passed and progress was made there was a inactivity problem with Caiy, he would always take these 3-4 days inactive periods that we couldnt get ahold of him via discord or twitter. NP there, however since there was releases it made it difficult to make the decision to launch without him. As a result, I delayed SOTW until further notice.
After that it was mainly being inactive, his little brother messing with his discord (Like fuck off not paying type of shit), and him stating that he just quit HCPvP. Afterwards, I felt that it was useless to keep working for nothing so I halted progress and announced Caiy's Decision on the official discord (Eventually removed).
The kicker here is that Caiy then switched to rebrand mode and then obtained Aodus.net (Recently, as of 9/21/2019). He then posted that hes selling Aodus.net for $30 and left the group. (Which is horrible considering his plan for HCPvP)
Working for HCPvP was a complete loss for me and it should be regarded that for Caiy you should play his servers or join him in any of his Social followings. He may be becoming more toxic by putting a twitter post about a server's files being released that he didnt like.

**» Zewr

Discord Client ID: 467892936613560360 (Zewr#0001)

Server Owner of BlackoutPvP and WrathHQ (Conceptualized WrathHQ, No Investment recorded)

Situation:
As a contextual help, Landen is currently the MAIN owner because of his access and purchases of the resources.
Landen and Slurrp and Zewr were discussing business when each of them ran into a disagreement. Landen and Slurrp were in this case against Zewr. Conversations mustve turned toxic and violent as they discussed it because as a result of the conversation, Zewr proceeded to commence to SWAT Landen. Whether or not this happened, there is proof of Zewr admitting to swatting Landen.
(https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/9AeP5mSq-4pDIS5XqoxEIiwjPtI7X9FWs-vxmNgo_e8/%3Fwidth%3D791%26height%3D450/https/images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/yEb7HcVl0bdj6Ktae4PhoUaYP-d6qBUIxKifS1uiKuQ/%253Fwidth%253D878%2526height%253D499/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/663191753448488960/663210382747238410/Screen_Shot_2020-01-04_at_9.41.05_PM.png?width=712&height=405)
Afterwards, Landen then revoked access to the Domain and the dedicated server therein. Landen was removed from the main discord for WrathHQ as Zewr created it.
WrathHQ is currently in rebrand mode as Zewr should not be able to recover the resources revoked from him. 
Please refrain from playing with Zewr or on his hardware that has access to your IP (Servers) due to his actions in the community.

I will keep this list updated as I find more people you MUST avoid. Thanks
