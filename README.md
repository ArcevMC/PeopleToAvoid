# PeopleToAvoid
This list is for people that have unjustly done wrong things to me or others.

Jaymesss: 
  Discord Client ID: 491775096298536981 (jaymesss#0001)
  Server Owner of PolyMC. (Also provided resources for the actual server, Hub, etc)
  Situation:
    I was a Trial-Mod on PolyMC accepted by a friend of mine surge360 (Well-known HCF member). There was other staff members too promoted
  by surge and the owners. Particularly Newtt#2064 who was a "egirl" who often would be a toxic to me only (for no reason). This lead on people
  that didnt know me to put a bad taste in the entire staff team and other owners. Zerkz is understanding and happens to knows me a little in the time I was in the server.
  On 8/5/2019, at 7:34pm I was banned from the PolyMC discord and in-game. Naturally, I wanted to know the reason behind the ban. After about 5 mins jaymesss responded by
  saying "because no one likes you" claiming I was annoying as a reason. I acted naturally in the time I was on the server and was never asked once to desist from any behaviour
  that would be "annoying". For future reference for anyone playing PolyMC and are seeing this, please avoid playing on the server when jaymesss is an owner.
  He promotes toxicity and other unjust things and are the catalyst for why the HCF community is such in a deep hole of bad people and bad actions.

I will keep this list updated as I find more people you MUST avoid. Thanks
